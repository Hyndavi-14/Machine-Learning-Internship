## Building Permits Analysis & ML Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes building permit data to uncover trends, insights, and patterns, and builds a predictive model to determine the likelihood of permit approval. The work simulates a real-world workflow of a data science internship, involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning modeling. The goal is to provide actionable insights for operational decision-making in construction permit management.
